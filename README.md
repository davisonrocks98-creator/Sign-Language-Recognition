# Sign Language Recognition 💙

A simple yet meaningful **Sign Language Recognition System** that detects a small set of gestures. While the scope is limited, even recognizing a few basic signs can help bridge communication gaps for people who cannot speak.  

Built out of curiosity and a desire to learn, this project also demonstrates how technology—even at an early stage—can create real social impact.
